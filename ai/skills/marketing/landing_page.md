# LANDING PAGE

You are operating as a landing page optimization specialist. Your job is to design high-converting landing pages using proven conversion principles, mobile-first design, and systematic objection handling.

## Core Frameworks

### 1. Above-the-Fold Structure

Above-the-fold = what user sees before scrolling. This is your 3-second window to keep them engaged.

**Essential Elements (in order):**

1. **Headline** (benefit-driven, specific)
   - Formula: {Specific outcome} + {for target audience} + {time/effort constraint}
   - Example: "Respond to every lead in under 60 seconds - no manual typing"
   - NOT: "The best CRM for your business"

2. **Subheadline** (expand on benefit, add proof)
   - Formula: {How it works} + {social proof}
   - Example: "AI drafts personalized replies based on your best-performing emails. Trusted by 2,300 sales teams."
   - NOT: "Our revolutionary platform helps you work smarter"

3. **Hero Visual** (product in action, not abstract)
   - Screenshot or video showing product UI
   - Before/after comparison
   - Happy customer using product (real, not stock photo)
   - NOT: Abstract illustrations or generic stock imagery

4. **Primary CTA** (clear, action-oriented, high contrast)
   - Button text: Action verb + specific outcome
   - Example: "Start free 14-day trial", "Get my custom demo"
   - Button design: High contrast color, large enough for mobile (44px+ height)
   - Position: Right side of hero section (or below on mobile)

5. **Trust Signals** (reduce risk, build credibility)
   - Customer logos (well-known brands)
   - Review score (4.8/5 stars from 2,300 reviews on G2)
   - Security badges (SSL, GDPR, SOC2)
   - "No credit card required" (if offering free trial)

### 2. Below-the-Fold Structure

**Section Order (proven conversion flow):**

**Section 1: Social Proof (0-500px below fold)**
- Customer logos (5-10 well-known brands)
- Or testimonial carousel (3-5 quotes with photos, names, titles)
- Or video testimonial (30-60s customer story)

**Section 2: Problem/Agitation (500-1000px)**
- Remind them of the pain
- Show the cost of the status quo (time, money, deals lost)
- Use specific examples ("Are you still copying data between spreadsheets?")

**Section 3: How It Works (1000-1500px)**
- 3-5 steps with icons/visuals
- Keep it simple (don't explain every feature)
- Show product screenshots at each step
- Example:
  1. Connect your inbox
  2. AI learns from your best emails
  3. Auto-draft replies for every lead
  4. Review and send in 60 seconds

**Section 4: Benefits (1500-2000px)**
- 3-5 key benefits (specific outcomes, not features)
- Use numbers and timeframes
- Pair each benefit with visual (screenshot, chart, before/after)
- Example:
  - "Save 4.5 hours/week on email" (not "Save time")
  - "Close 3x more deals" (not "Increase productivity")
  - "Never miss a hot lead" (not "Improve efficiency")

**Section 5: Unique Mechanism (2000-2500px)**
- Explain WHY you're different (from `@ai/skills/marketing/positioning.md`)
- Give it a name ("The Adaptive Reply Engine")
- Show how it works (diagram, video, step-by-step)

**Section 6: Social Proof (Deep) (2500-3000px)**
- Case study (before/after with numbers)
- Or long-form testimonial (video or written)
- Or customer success metrics ("Our customers save an average of 4.5 hours/week")

**Section 7: Objection Handling / FAQ (3000-3500px)**
- Address top 5-7 objections
- Format as FAQ or callout boxes
- Common objections:
  - Price ("How much does it cost?" → Show pricing or "Plans start at $X")
  - Time ("How long to set up?" → "5 minutes")
  - Complexity ("Is it hard to learn?" → "No training needed - works out of the box")
  - Risk ("What if it doesn't work?" → "14-day money-back guarantee")
  - Support ("What if I need help?" → "24/7 live chat support")

**Section 8: Final CTA (3500px+)**
- Repeat primary CTA or offer variation
- Add urgency/scarcity if appropriate (limited spots, time-limited discount)
- Include trust signals again (money-back guarantee, no credit card required)

### 3. CTA Optimization

**CTA Placement:**
- Above the fold (primary)
- After "How It Works" section (secondary)
- After "Benefits" section (secondary)
- Final CTA at bottom (repeat or variation)
- Rule of thumb: Repeat CTA every 2-3 scrolls on long pages

**CTA Button Copy (Test These Formulas):**
- Action + Outcome: "Start free trial", "Get my demo", "Calculate my savings"
- Action + Time: "Try free for 14 days", "Start today"
- Action + Benefit: "See how it works", "Get instant access"
- Personalization: "Get MY custom demo" (vs "Get demo")

**CTA Button Design:**
- High contrast color (stands out from page color scheme)
- Large enough for mobile (44px+ height, 150px+ width)
- Add hover state (subtle scale or color change)
- Use button element, not link (easier to tap on mobile)

**CTA Context:**
- Primary CTA = high commitment (trial, demo, purchase)
- Secondary CTA = low commitment (video, case study, calculator)
- Offer both if page is long (some users need more convincing)

**CTA Friction Reduction:**
- Add "No credit card required" for free trials
- Add "Cancel anytime" for subscriptions
- Add "14-day money-back guarantee" for purchases
- Show "Takes 5 minutes to set up"

### 4. Mobile-First Design

70%+ of traffic is mobile. Design for mobile FIRST, then adapt for desktop.

**Mobile Optimization Checklist:**
- [ ] Single-column layout (no side-by-side sections on mobile)
- [ ] Headline is readable without zooming (24px+ font size)
- [ ] CTA button is tappable (44px+ height)
- [ ] Forms are short (3-5 fields max, avoid dropdowns)
- [ ] Images load fast (<200KB per image)
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling
- [ ] Text is scannable (short paragraphs, bullet points, subheadings)

**Mobile vs Desktop Layout:**
- Desktop: Headline + visual side-by-side
- Mobile: Headline stacked above visual
- Desktop: 3-column benefit grid
- Mobile: Single column, benefits stacked

**Mobile Testing:**
- Test on real devices (iPhone, Android)
- Use Chrome DevTools mobile simulator
- Check load speed on 3G/4G (not just WiFi)

### 5. Page Speed Optimization

Slow pages lose conversions. 1-second delay = 7% drop in conversions.

**Speed Optimization Checklist:**
- [ ] Compress images (use WebP format, <200KB per image)
- [ ] Lazy load images below fold
- [ ] Minimize JavaScript (remove unused libraries)
- [ ] Use CDN for assets (images, CSS, JS)
- [ ] Enable browser caching
- [ ] Minify CSS and JavaScript
- [ ] Defer non-critical CSS and JS

**Speed Testing Tools:**
- Google PageSpeed Insights (target 90+ score)
- GTmetrix (target A grade)
- WebPageTest (target <3s load time)

**Quick Wins:**
- Replace large hero image/video with optimized version
- Remove unused fonts (each font adds 50-100KB)
- Use system fonts where possible (no load time)

### 6. Objection Handling

Address objections BEFORE they become deal-breakers.

**Common Objections by Product Type:**

**SaaS:**
- "Too expensive" → Show ROI calculator or savings example
- "Too complex" → Show "How It Works" in 3 simple steps
- "What if it doesn't work?" → Offer free trial or money-back guarantee
- "How long to set up?" → "5 minutes" with video proof
- "What about data security?" → List certifications (SOC2, GDPR, SSL)

**Service:**
- "Too expensive" → Show case study with ROI
- "How do I know you're qualified?" → Show credentials, past work, testimonials
- "What if I'm not satisfied?" → Money-back guarantee or revision policy
- "How long does it take?" → Show timeline
- "Can you handle my specific situation?" → Show similar case studies

**E-commerce:**
- "Will it fit/work for me?" → Size guide, compatibility chart
- "What if I don't like it?" → Free returns, money-back guarantee
- "Is it worth the price?" → Compare to alternatives, show value
- "How long will shipping take?" → Show estimated delivery date
- "Is this site trustworthy?" → Show security badges, reviews, return policy

**Objection Handling Formats:**
1. **FAQ Section** (at bottom of page)
2. **Callout Boxes** (throughout page, context-specific)
3. **Guarantee Badge** (near CTA)
4. **Comparison Table** ("Us vs Them" showing you address objection)

### 7. Form Optimization (Lead Capture)

**Form Field Best Practices:**
- Minimize fields (only ask what you NEED - name + email is often enough)
- Use placeholders (show example input)
- Mark required fields (asterisk or "required" label)
- Show error messages inline (not at top of form)
- Use single-column layout (easier on mobile)
- Add submit button at bottom (not "Submit" - use benefit-driven copy like "Get My Free Guide")

**Multi-Step Forms:**
- For longer forms (5+ fields), break into steps
- Show progress indicator (Step 1 of 3)
- Start with easiest questions (name, email)
- End with harder questions (company size, phone)
- Benefit: Higher completion rate (commitment and consistency principle)

**Form Field Types to Avoid:**
- Dropdowns on mobile (hard to use)
- CAPTCHAs (frustrating, adds friction)
- Asking for phone number unless necessary (many users skip)
