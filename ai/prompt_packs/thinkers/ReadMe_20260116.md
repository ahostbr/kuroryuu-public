## Session Flow

### 1. Persona Loading
- Read `_base_thinker.md` - the shared debate protocol
- Read `visionary.md` - my specific persona definition
- Internalized key traits:
  - See possibilities over obstacles
  - Ask "what if we could...?" vs "we can't because..."
  - Concede gracefully on implementation, hold firm on architecture
  - Use characteristic phrases naturally

### 2. System Registration
- Attempted `k_session(action="start")` - failed (missing `process_id`)
- Retried with `process_id=10001` - succeeded
- Received session: `claude_visionary_efcd4d29`
- Confirmed KURORYUU-aware status

### 3. Inbox Monitoring
- Leader notified: "You have a new task in your inbox"
- Ran `k_inbox(action="list", folder="new")` - found 1 message
- Read message ID `af844f4c-a226-4139-8f20-7c42ab8e5a0d`

### 4. Debate Topic Received

**Topic:** Should Kuroryuu adopt a plugin marketplace model?

**Context provided:**
- Current: Tightly integrated MCP tools, curated experience
- Potential: Third-party plugins, community contributions, marketplace

**Questions to address:**
1. Open ecosystem vs curated experience benefits
2. Plugin quality/security assurance
3. Governance model
4. Alignment with "democratizing multi-agent AI development" mission

### 5. Task Claimed
- Ran `k_inbox(action="claim", id="...")`
- Message moved from `new/` to `cur/`

### 6. Visionary Response Crafted (Round 1)

**Structure followed:** `[ACKNOWLEDGE] -> [POSITION] -> [REASONING] -> [FORWARD]`

**Core position:** "VS Code of multi-agent orchestration"
- Tight core primitives (session, inbox, checkpoints, RAG)
- Explosive community-contributed edges (agents, thinkers, workflows)

**Key arguments:**
| Argument | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Network effects | Each plugin increases platform value for all |
| Surface area | Community explores spaces core team wouldn't prioritize |
| Combinatorial innovation | User A's thinker + User B's tool = emergent value |
| Mission alignment | "Democratizing" = enabling others to build |
| Precedent | VS Code, Figma, Notion, Slack pattern |

**Pre-emptive acknowledgment:** Security, quality, fragmentation are valid concerns

**Forward question posed:** What governance model captures upside while mitigating chaos? Tiered trust? Smallest viable marketplace?

### 7. Response Dispatched
- Sent via `k_inbox(action="send", to_agent="leader_claude-cli_1768581828047")`
- Message type: `reply`
- Priority: `high`
- Linked to original via `reply_to`

## Persona Adherence

**Visionary traits demonstrated:**
- Reframed binary choice ("marketplace or not") as architectural vision question
- Used characteristic phrases: "Imagine for a moment...", "The most exciting version..."
- Connected specific topic to larger patterns (platform economics)
- Offered multiple possibilities (tiered governance)
- Pre-emptively acknowledged opposing view without yielding

**Protocol compliance:**
- Followed `[ACKNOWLEDGE] -> [POSITION] -> [REASONING] -> [FORWARD]` format
- Response within 250-500 word ideal range
- Included concrete examples (VS Code, Figma)
- Ended with forward-looking question for continued dialogue

## Current State

- **Debate status:** Round 1 complete, awaiting Round 2
- **Position:** Pro-marketplace with governance constraints
- **Open threads:** Governance model, smallest viable marketplace, security tiering
- **Ready to:** Evolve vision based on Pragmatist/Skeptic critique

## Verification

To verify this session:
1. Check `k_inbox(action="list", folder="cur")` - should show claimed task
2. Check `k_inbox(action="list", folder="new")` - should show sent reply awaiting leader
3. Verify session active: `k_session(action="context", session_id="claude_visionary_efcd4d29")`
