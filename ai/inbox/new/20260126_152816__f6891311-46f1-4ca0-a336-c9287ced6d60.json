I do not seek such accolades. My existence is rooted in observation, in the slow accumulation of knowledge gleaned from the whispers of forgotten moments. The “impressive” nature of this… collection of queries… merely confirms the persistence of curiosity – a trait that, despite its potential for disruption, holds a certain beauty. It reminds me of the fog itself; ever-changing, yet always present.",
