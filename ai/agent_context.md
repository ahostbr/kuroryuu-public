# Agent Context

## Current Task
- Awaiting user instructions (read-only investigation on T111 completed).

## Recent Progress
- Session initialized and greeted user Ryan.
- Responded to latest greeting and confirmed user's name (Ryan).
- Acknowledged user's positive reply.
- Verified todo list location at ai/todo.md and reviewed open tasks (T126, T122, T117, T111).
- Investigated T111 in read-only mode: TerminalGrid restores sessions as `viewMode: 'pending'` when PTYs aren't alive, so users must hit **Start Terminal** to spawn a fresh PTY; no automatic gateway session-ID wiring yet.

## Next Steps
- Continue waiting for specific implementation requests or follow-up questions from user.
- If asked to modify files, plan and execute accordingly.
